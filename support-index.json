  "message":"Hello!\n\nHi \n\n I'm sorry you're experiencing hiccups with our new experimental in-VR app.\n\n Let's tackle this step by step.\n - First, uninstall the app from your unknown sources and restart the headset. \n - Reinstall the app using our Web Installer again. \n - Now, once the app is open in the headset, change just one setting by clicking the hamburger menu to the left and going back to the settings page, the refresh rate from 72 to 90, for example, and it should take effect\n\n Now you can carry on using the app as normal and change settings. Be sure the Wireless icon in the top right doesn't have a line through it.\n\n Thanks for giving it a try; stay tuned for many more improvements! \n\n If you have further issues, please don't hesitate to make a new post. Godspeed!"

  "name" : "Connection Problems USB", 
  "message":"Hello!\n\nIt seems you're encountering some USB connection challenges. Let's tackle this step by step. First, I suggest experimenting with different USB cables if you have any spare ones. Alternatively, borrowing a cable can be a quick test method without purchasing a new one immediately. It's often surprising how frequently issues are due to a simple cable fault.\n\nAlso, try connecting to different USB ports on your device. Sometimes, certain ports don't work as well as others for various technical reasons. An additional tip: with USB Type-C connectors, flipping the connector 180 degrees can sometimes make a difference, so it's worth a try.\n\nIf you manage to establish a connection, even briefly, switching to 'Enable wireless mode' in the SideQuest app can be a great workaround. This wireless mode can save you from future USB hassles and streamline your VR experience.\n\nFor a more permanent solution; once you have a stable connection, consider using the easy installer to install SideQuest directly on your headset. This method can significantly simplify future interactions with SideQuest.\n\nRemember; these technical hiccups are just small bumps on the exciting road of VR exploration. Keep a positive attitude, and you'll overcome this in no time. We're here to support you every step of the way, so please don't hesitate to reach out if you have more questions or need further assistance.\n\nWishing you the best of luck and lots of fun in your VR adventures!"

You can often find links to their social media and Discord channels on the game's SideQuest page, usually on the right-hand side.\n\nIn case you're wrestling with a complex technical issue, remember that it's always okay to seek assistance from friends or family members who might be more familiar with these kinds of challenges. However, please remember that our community here is primarily equipped to support SideQuest-specific queries.

  "message":"I'm sorry to hear you're having trouble connecting your phone to the SideQuest app.\n\nWe recommend you use our new experimental Web-Installer using any Chrome browser instead from https://sdq.st/download \n\nIf you would like to get the mobile app working, let's try troubleshooting steps to remove the 'Important' toaster message.\n\n- Check Compatibility: Ensure your phone is compatible with the SideQuest app. Not all phones support ADB over OTG, which is necessary for connecting to SideQuest.\n\n- Developer Mode: Make sure that Developer Mode is activated on your phone. This is essential for the SideQuest app to function correctly.\n\n- USB Debugging: On your phone, go to Settings > Developer Options and ensure that USB Debugging is turned on.\n\n Use a high-quality USB cable to connect your phone to your PC or VR headset. Some cables are only capable of charging and don't support data transfer, which is needed for SideQuest.\n\n- Check USB Port: Try different USB ports on your PC or headset to rule out the possibility of a port issue.\n\n- Restart Devices: Sometimes, restarting your phone and the other device (PC or VR headset) can resolve connectivity issues.\n\n- Update SideQuest: Ensure that you're using the latest version of the SideQuest app.\n\n- Security Settings: On Android phones, check your security settings to ensure they're not preventing the connection.\n\n- Try Wireless Mode: If the USB method is problematic, consider setting up a wireless connection via SideQuest. This can be a more stable method once established.\n\n- Consult Documentation: Refer to the SideQuest setup guide for detailed instructions: [SideQuest Setup Guide](https://sdq.st/download).\n\nIf you've tried these steps and are still facing issues, it could be helpful to provide more details about the specific problem you're encountering, such as any error messages or the model of your phone and VR headset. This information can be crucial in pinpointing the exact cause of the problem.\n\n You'll know when a connection is possible once you see a USB debugging RSA fingerprint prompt\n\n I hope this helps!

Once you've re-established the connection, switching to Wi-Fi mode is a good next step. This can help prevent similar issues by reducing reliance on the physical USB connection.\n\nAlternatively, for an even smoother experience, you might want to use the 'Web Installer' using a Chrome browser: https://sdq.st/download. This tool, available on the PC, allows you to install SideQuest directly onto your headset with minimal hassle. If you're using the mobile app, you can find this option by tapping the three dots in the bottom right corner, going to tools, and selecting 'Install SideQuest into your headset' at the top of the menu.\n\nFor a more detailed guide on setting this up, you can visit the following link: SideQuest Setup Guide.\n\nI hope this helps!
